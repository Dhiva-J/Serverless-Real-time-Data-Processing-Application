Implementing a Serverless Architecture for a Real-time Data Processing Application

To implement a serverless architecture for a real-time data processing application using AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB, follow this step-by-step guide:

1.	Set Up the Data Stream with Amazon Kinesis
Create a Kinesis Data Stream: Kinesis will capture real-time data for processing. 
In AWS Management Console:
•	Go to Kinesis and create a new Kinesis Data Stream.
•	Choose an appropriate number of shards based on data input (1 shard supports 1MB/s input and 2MB/s output).

3.	Set Up DynamoDB for Data Storage
Create a DynamoDB Table:
•	Go to the DynamoDB service in the AWS Console.
•	Create a new table with a primary key (this will be the key from the processed data, e.g., id).

5.	Set Up AWS Lambda for Data Processing
Create a Lambda Function:
•	Navigate to AWS Lambda in the AWS Console.
•	Create a new function using the runtime environment suitable for your code (Node.js, Python, etc.).
•	Grant necessary IAM permissions to Lambda to read from Kinesis and write to DynamoDB.
Configure Event Source:
•	In the Lambda function settings, add Kinesis Data Stream as the event source.
•	Set the batch size (the number of records Lambda will process at a time) and trigger settings.
Write Lambda Code:
•	Your Lambda function should process incoming data (e.g., filtering, transformation) from the stream.
•	After processing, write or update the processed data to DynamoDB.

Copy the lambda_function.py code and insert it into the lambda function

High-Level Architecture Overview
1.	Amazon API Gateway – Provides a RESTful API interface to accept incoming HTTP requests.
2.	Amazon Kinesis – Captures and streams real-time data for processing.
3.	AWS Lambda – Processes the data, running the serverless function.
4.	Amazon DynamoDB – Stores the processed data for persistence.
5.	AWS CloudWatch – Monitors the system's logs, metrics, and performance, setting alarms when necessary.

Benefits of this Serverless Architecture:
•	Scalability: Automatically scales based on incoming traffic without managing any infrastructure.
•	Cost Efficiency: Pay only for what you use (API Gateway requests, Kinesis stream throughput, Lambda invocations, DynamoDB storage).
•	Real-time Processing: Kinesis and Lambda handle real-time data streams with low-latency processing.
•	Monitoring and Observability: CloudWatch provides full monitoring capabilities for tracking performance and setting up alerts.

Testing:
•	After deploying the Lambda function, you can test it by sending records to the Kinesis Data Stream and checking if they are correctly inserted into DynamoDB.
•	Verify that records are being stored as expected in the DynamoDB console.

Python script using the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to put records into a Kinesis Data Stream in batches of 100. This will simulate sending records with random telemetry in groups of up to 100 records at a time.

Download the generate_telemetry_records_kinesis.py file locally, and use Visual Studio code software to test this file.
